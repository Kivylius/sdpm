_SDPMIN_ or session description protocol minifier is a tool that compresses the [SDP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCSessionDescription/sdp) [WebRTC offer]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/createOffer() to a tiny string that can be stored in a signaling server or even shared over any messaging platform for a server-less approach.

## Demo

The demo includes a simple playground to showcase the compressing and uncompressing of the SDP offer object.

- [Demo Playground](https://kivylius.github.io/sdpmin/)

## Quick Start

Just install the sdpmin like this:

```sh
npm i sdpmin -D
```

```js
import { pack, unpack } from "sdpmin";

const packedStr = pack(SDP_STRING); // output: SKk12k3kdDk2Dj21jk31jk23j....
const sdp = unpack(SDP_COMPRESSED_STRING); // output: -o:123123123....
```

## Versions

The default version that is exported is `v1`. This outputs a safe lossless compression, other version are available can can be imported with `VX` prefix e.g:

```js
import { packV0, unpackV0 } from 'sdpmin';

const packedStr = packV0(...);
const sdp = unpakcV0(...)
```

- **v0** - full output without compression.
- **v1** - default lossless compression.
- **v2\*** - (todo: soon) Smaller bundle size & lossless compression.
- **v3\*** - (todo: soon) Aggressive compression that is lossy.

Check the Demo above for examples outputs.

## Starting playground
